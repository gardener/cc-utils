'''
An implementation of the (undocumented [0]) RESTful HTTP API offered by concourse
[1]. It was reverse-engineered based on [2], as well using Chrome developer tools and
POST-Man [3].

Usage:
------

Users will probably want to create an instance of ConcourseApiVX, passing a
ConcourseConfig object to the `from_cfg` factory function.

Other types defined in this module are not intended to be instantiated by users.
