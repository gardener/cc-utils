    Create a new commit, with the passed tree-ish as parent, in the given repository.

    Note that this implementation only supports toplevel submodules. To be removed in a
    future version.

    Parameters
    ------
    repo_path : str
        Path to a directory containing an intialised git-repo with a submodule to update.
    tree_ish : str
        Valid tree-ish to use as base for creating the new commit. This will be used as parent for the
        commit created by this function.
        Example: 'master' for the head of the master-branch.
    submodule_path : str
        Path (relative to the repository root) to the submodule. Must be immediately below the root
        of the repository.
    commit_hash : str
        The hash the submodule should point to in the created commit. This should be a valid commit-
        hash in the submodule's repository.
    author : str,
        Will be set as author of the created commit
    email : str
        Will be set for the author of the created commit

    Returns
    ------
    str
        The hexadecimal SHA-1 hash of the created commit
