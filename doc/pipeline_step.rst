Pipeline Steps
**************

Pipeline steps define the actual payloads that are run during job executions. Each pipeline
step is run in a defined container image. Components may specify an arbitrary graph of steps.
Some traits add steps to build jobs as well (see traits documentation).

Each build step **must** be given a unique name (per job). By default, an executable named
`.ci/<step_name>` is expected in the main repository's work tree. It is run inside a container
with a specifiable container image with a defined set of environment variables.

The resulting exit code is used to determine whether or not the step execution has succeeded.
A zero exit code is interpreted as success, wheras non-zero exit codes are interpreted as
failures.

* all job steps are executed in parallel by default
* dependendencies between steps may be declared
* job steps may publish changes to repositories

        ANOTHER: 'pipeline_descriptor.get("name")' # assign pipeline name to ANOTHER
