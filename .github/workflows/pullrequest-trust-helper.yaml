name: Pull-Request-Trust Helper

# description: |
#   An opinionated re-usable workflow to help with trusting Pull-Requests. Depending on the
#   trustedness of a pullrequest's author, the workflow will either add an indication (via
#   a "needs-review"-label) that a label needs to be added, or automatically add a "trusted-label".
#
#   A user is considered trusted, if:
#     - he is member of the pullrequest-target-repository's organisation
#     - he is member of any of the `trusted-teams` (input to this workflow)
#     - his association w/ target-repository is any of:
#       - COLLABORATOR
#       - MEMBER
#       - OWNER
#
#   Note: This workflow is intended to only by triggered for the following actions for pull-requests:
#   - opened
#   - edited
#   - reopened
#   - synchronize
#
#   If triggered from other sources, the workflow will early-exit with a warning, and have no
#   effect.
