name: Component-Diff
description: |
  An opinionated workflow to determine the component-diff between the current version (read from
  base-component-descriptor) and the greatest published release-version. Because the component-
  descriptor and OCM releases repository is read from it, the `prepare.yaml` workflow must be
  executed beforehand.

    inputs:
      ocm-repositories:
        required: false

        description: |
          A comma-separated list of OCM-Repository-URLs to use for looking up
          OCM-Component-Descriptors. If not passed, the value will be read from the
          `prepare-workflow-values` artefact, which is by default emitted by the
          `prepare.yaml` workflow (which must have been run prior to calling this workflow for
          this to succeed).
