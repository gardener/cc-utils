      k8s-api-endpoint:
        required: false
        type: string
        description: |
          The URL referring to the k8s-apiserver-endpoint in which the testmachinery-instance to use
          runs. Pipeline-Runs will authenticate against this cluster using OIDC.

          Note that in case of the default-cluster, only a subset of repositories below
          https://github.com/gardener are authorised. Runs triggered from forked repositories will
          also fail, unless `on.pull_request_target` is used as trigger-event.
      k8s-api-ca:
        required: false
        type: string
      cluster-cfg:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: gardener/clusters/testmachinery-canary.yaml
        description: |
          Refers to a file located in a GitHub repository containing the k8s-api-endpoint as well as
          the k8s-api-ca of the cluster in which the testmachinery-instance runs. Pipeline-runs will
          authenticate against this cluster using OIDC. If the `k8s-api-endpoint` _and_ `k8s-api-ca`
          inputs are specified as well, those will take precedence over this input parameter.

          The path must adhere to the following format: `<org>/<repo>/<path-to-file.yaml>`.

          The file is expected to have to following format:
          ```
          api: <api-url>
          ca: <base64-encoded-ca>
          ```

          Note that in case of the default-cluster, only a subset of repositories below
          https://github.com/gardener is authorised. Runs triggered from forked repositories will
          also fail, unless `on.pull_request_target` is used as trigger-event.
      kubeconfig-path:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: /tmp/kubeconfig.yaml
        description: |
          The path to which the generated kubeconfig will be generated (this needs to be passed
          to `testrunner`).
      test-command:
        required: true
        type: string
        description: |
          The command to trigger test-machinery. Will be run within a bash-script without quoting
          or escaping.

          For convenience, the `testrunner_run`-environment-variable is set to:

          ```
          testrunner run --tm-kubeconfig-path=<kubeconfig-path>
          ```

          For example, the following value might be passed:

          ```
          ${testrunner_run} \
            --no-execution-group \
            --testrun-prefix tm-extension-aws
          ```
