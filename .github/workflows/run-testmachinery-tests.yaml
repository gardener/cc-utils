          The URL referring to the k8s-apiserver-endpoint in which the testmachinery-instance to use
          runs. Pipeline-Runs will authenticate against this cluster using OIDC.

          Note that in case of the default-cluster, only a subset of repositories below
          https://github.com/gardener are authorised. Runs triggered from forked repositories will
          also fail, unless `on.pull_request_target` is used as trigger-event.

          The path to which the generated kubeconfig will be generated (this needs to be passed

          The command to trigger test-machinery. Will be run within a bash-script without quoting
          or escaping.

          For convenience, the `testrunner_run`-environment-variable is set to:

          ```
          testrunner run --tm-kubeconfig-path=<kubeconfig-path>
          ```

          For example, the following value might be passed:

          ```
          ${testrunner_run} \
            --no-execution-group \
            --testrun-prefix tm-extension-aws
          ```
